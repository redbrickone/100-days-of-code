# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 31st, 2016

**Today's Progress**: I started the freeCodeSchool tic-tac-toe challenge. I didn't get that far, but made a dynamic jquery function that passes your parameters into your DOM selectors.

**Thoughts**: I thought it was really neat making the function that I made, even though it might not be that crazy of a thing. Usually I only make self-invoking functions, so this one was cool.

### Day 2: September 1st, 2016

**Today's Progress**: I started working on the tic-tac-toe game again in codepen. All-in-all, i got two if statements. I started to try and do them in a switch statement, but wasn't sure how to check .hasClass() in the switch statemnt, so I'll have to leave that until tomorrow. :)

**Thoughts**: A little bummed I didn't get the swith statement, but intrigued to figure it out. Also, I'm pretty sure I have no idea how to set up the logic for the game to actually work, but I have 98 days left to figure it out!
