# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: I started the freeCodeSchool tic-tac-toe challenge. I didn't get that far, but made a dynamic jquery function that passes your parameters into your DOM selectors.

**Thoughts**: I thought it was really neat making the function that I made, even though it might not be that crazy of a thing. Usually I only make self-invoking functions, so this one was cool.
